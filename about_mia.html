                <h2>About Young Voices</h2>
                <p>Young Voices was created by a group of young Teenage girls who see a big issue with Chicago's crime, gang violence, poverty and homelessness. So we created our website to let people have a voice, and to express their feels about the violence and if they had some personal experience with the violence or how it affects their everyday lifestyle.</p>
                <p>We hope that this website influences people to want to put their story out there openly and anonymously.</p>
                <p>We've worked really hard for this and we only had a week to try and make a difference so we hope people enjoy it!</p>
                </p> Please get to know about us individually below!!! If you have any questions please email us at: braveyoungvoices6@gmail.com<p>

                        <p>Melina thinks Young Voices will be a great website to help young boys get away from violence, gangs,etc. This website will make teenage boys and others, feel safe to express themselves about their experiencs with violence, gangs, and etc. By teenage boys and others sharing their stories anonymously to others, they are helping eachother to get out of any situation they might find themselves in. This way anyone who joins Young Voices will know they are not alone and there are many more teenagers and adults who are probably going through or facing the same issues they are. This website is just to make teen boys and company feel safe and let them know that they can change their lifestyle.</p>

                        <p>Mia believes this website opens up everyones heart, mind, body, and soul. It creates a safe palce to be heard, no one is ignored and everyone will be acknowledged reguardless of how challenging their story may be. Also it's a good place to understand why a lot of the issues in our city are what they mainly are because of someones past or what maybe happening to them in the present. Everything happens for a reason. We want our website to be one of those reasons something good happens. We want everyone who joins our young voices community to be heard and  we want to be heard as well which is why we creaed this website. It's time to take a stand.</p>

                        <p>Kely believes it is very significant to give people the resources that they need in one single story told by themselves instead of them trying to figure out their issues without being able to tell their own story. To keep everyone safe, we as, a 6 person teenage girl team we decided it should be anonymous so everyone is comfortable sharing their stories. Many people voices are ignored for many reasons, such as skin color background, class, etc. Chicago faces many gang related problems that shouldn't be ignored. As a whole city we should work together to find one solution instead of people individually finding solutions. We should hear eachothers voices which is why we created this website so everyone can be heard.</p>

They can also find help through the website with hotlines or connecting with people. Also other websites that can help steer the teens and people into the right direction.</p>
